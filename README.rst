	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -i <ip>, --ip <ip>    IP address of mpd server
	  -p <port>, --port <port>
				Port mpd server is listening on
	  --maxnum <num>        Maximal number of songs in playlist
	  --dist <num>          Add new song if only <x> songs are left to play in current playlist
	  --norepeat            Don't add songs which are already in playlist.

Example
-------

Smarty could be used like this

::

    smarty --norepeat --maxnum 3000 --verbose --exclude Comedy

This would only add songs which are not already in the current playlist and allow a maximum number of 3000 songs (deletes from the beginning if that number is exceeded). It will furthermore display the genre of each added song and not add the genre 'Comedy'.
